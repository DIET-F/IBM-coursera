## Excersize 8
In this section, we will demonstrate basic arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication.
a = 5
b = 4
addition = a + b
multiplication = a * b
print(f"Addition: {addition}")
print(f"Multiplication: {multiplication}")
##Excersize 9
minutes = 120
hours = minutes / 60
print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours} hours")
